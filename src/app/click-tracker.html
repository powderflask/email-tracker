				<h2>Click Trackers</h2>
				<p>
					A "Click Tracker" uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_redirect" target="_blank">HTTP Redirect</a>
					to track clicks on a link.

				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p>
					When you click a link, you are making a request to a web server.  That server can track you!
				</p>
				<p>
					There are 3 components to a Click Tracker:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A link that appears to link to a useful page, but actually links to the click tracker.</li>
					<li>A web server that listens for requests for the click tracker and records
						information about each request, which may include
						the requester's email address, their IP address, the time of the request, which browser they use, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						A silent "redirect" to the page the user actually thought they were being linked to.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Using a Click Tracker</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Request the click tracker manually by clicking a tracking link, like this one:
						<?php
						$path = rewriteURL(TRACK_CLICK) . '?tk=via_website&url=http://google.ca/';
						echo('<a href="'. $path .'" title="Manually request click tracker">Google.ca</a>');
						?>
					</li>
					<li>
						Visit the Tracker's Database to view the link click tracking data collected so far:
						<?php
						$path = rewriteURL(HACKER_SITE)."?track_type=click";
						echo('<a href="'. $path .'" title="Tracker\'s Database">Tracker\'s Database</a>');
						?>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Protecting your privacy from Click Trackers</h3>
				<p>
					Most browsers and email clients let you inspect a link before clicking on it:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Hover over the link with your cursor to view the URL you are actually linking to.
					</li>
					<li>
						Look for suspicious host names and tracking codes -- don't click if you see them
					</li>
					<li>
						Visit the site without being tracked by copying the link location and editing out all the tracking codes.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>WARNING</h3>
				<p>
					Tracking clicks without permission is certainly of questionable ethics and may be against the law in some
					jurisdictions.
