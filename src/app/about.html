				<h3>Why Learn about Tracking Technologies?</h3>
				<p>
					It is hard to imagine how simply opening an email or clicking a link can reveal private information.
					<br />
					The idea behind UTrackIt is to let students do the tracking so they can experience it first hand.
					This reflects my basic teaching philosophy - Computer Science is a contact sport - learn by doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					UTrackIt's target audience is novice programmers or non-programmers interested in understanding more about web privacy issues.
					The code and interface are intended to be simple enough that non-technical readers can understand how it works.
